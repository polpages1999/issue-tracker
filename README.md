# Issue Tracker
RESTful API that allows users to track issues, such as bugs and feature requests.

The API can be accessed by sending requests to the following URLs:

/api/issues/ to get a list of all issues
/api/issues/:id to get a specific issue by ID
/api/issues/ to create a new issue
/api/issues/:id to update a specific issue
/api/issues/:id to delete a specific issue

The API is implemented using the Express framework and Node.js. The issue data is stored in a MongoDB database.

You can see the live version of the code and running app in my Repl: https://replit.com/@polpages1999/issue-tracker?v=1
